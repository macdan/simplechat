SimpleChat
==========

So far this project is mainly just an exercise for myself in using websockets with Erlang and Cowboy.
It starts an HTTP listener on port 8080. Requests to all urls all result in the same thing. 
There is only one handler, the websocket chatroom.

Requests to http://localhost:8080/ are served the client.html file, which contains the chat client html, css and javascript.

Requests to ws://localhost:8080/ will spawn a client process (using simplechat_wshandler) which registers an event handler with the chatroom, an gen_event process. When the socket is closed, the event handler is removed.
